In our CI/CD pipeline, we incorporate HashiCorp Vault and SonarQube as essential components for secure secret management and code quality analysis. These tools are deployed as Docker containers in ec2 or serverless instances, depending on infrastructure requirements.

HashiCorp Vault securely stores sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and Kubernetes secrets, ensuring centralized secret management with fine-grained access control.
SonarQube performs static code analysis (SAST) to detect code vulnerabilities, security risks, and maintainability issues. By hosting it as a Docker container, we achieve flexibility in deployment and seamless integration with GitHub Actions.
Both services operate in an automated workflow, enhancing security and compliance without manual intervention.
CI/CD Security & Compliance Documentation

1. Overview
The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, security scanning, and deployment of containerized microservices to a Kubernetes cluster. It integrates security and compliance mechanisms at multiple stages, ensuring a robust and resilient deployment process.

2. Pipeline Components & Tools
Version Control: GitHub
CI/CD Orchestration: GitHub Actions
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform & Helm
Security Automation:
SAST (Static Code Analysis): SonarQube
Secret Scanning: Gitleaks
Container Vulnerability Scanning: Trivy
DAST (Dynamic Security Testing): OWASP ZAP
Secret Management: HashiCorp Vault
Cloud Security Compliance: AWS Security Hub
Deployment:
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
RBAC Enforcement: Kubernetes RBAC policies


3. CI/CD Workflow
Step 1: Code Commit & Security Scans
Developer pushes code to GitHub.
GitHub Actions triggers pipeline execution.
SAST Analysis (SonarQube) checks for vulnerabilities in source code.
Secret Scanning (Gitleaks) detects hardcoded secrets.
Step 2: Build & Container Scanning
Docker image is built from the source code.
Trivy scans the image for vulnerabilities before deployment.
Step 3: Deployment & Compliance Enforcement
Terraform provisions AWS EKS infrastructure.
Helm deploys the application to Kubernetes.
RBAC policies are enforced for least-privilege access.
AWS Security Hub runs compliance checks.

  
Step 4: Dynamic Testing & Monitoring
OWASP ZAP performs DAST to identify runtime security risks.
Findings are reported and stored in security dashboards.
4. Security & Compliance Enhancements
Automated Remediation: If vulnerabilities are detected, the pipeline can halt the deployment or escalate alerts.
Secret Rotation: Vault dynamically manages and rotates credentials.
Real-Time Security Reports: Generated for audit and compliance tracking.

  
5. Conclusion
This secure CI/CD pipeline enforces security best practices, automates compliance checks, and ensures efficient deployment of microservices while minimizing security risks.
